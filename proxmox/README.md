# Proxmox Homelab Scripts

This repository contains scripts and configurations for managing my Proxmox-based homelab.

- The **packer** directory provides Packer templates and scripts for building custom Ubuntu 24.04 VM templates on Proxmox.
- The **terraform** directory contains Terraform configurations to automate the creation of VM instances from those templates.

These tools help streamline the deployment and management of virtual machines in my homelab environment.
